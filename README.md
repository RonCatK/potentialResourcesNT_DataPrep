# Overview

This is a data preparation module to harmonize different anthropogenic disturbance datasets, more specifically, mining and oil/gas. It's intended for the Northwest Territories region (default) and is idiosyncratic.This means this module is NOT generalizable, but can be used as basis for other types of development. The objective is to create one standardized layer for each of the potential resources that has increasing values for most prioritized places (i.e., higher values, more likely structures will appear).
